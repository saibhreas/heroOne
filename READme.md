## Purpose

### This REPO is two part demonstration of my work.

This repo contains an app that is a basic demonstration of a REACT based web page

#### Part One:  *READme.md*  and additional **MD** files chronicle the progression through the my build of a simple REACT page.

This *READme.MD* is published as a demonstration of basic:

* Documentation standards
* Technical writing
* Understanding of technical concepts
* Example of writing style

*READme.md* files should be at the least: readable, concise, organized, and succinct.  They should have a style that reflects the purpose of the repository, the project, or the app it represent.
